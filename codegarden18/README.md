# codegarden18
semester project at EAL web-dev


## install notes

- web.config file is required to connect to the database, please request this from the author. 
- If the project fails to run in visual studio, a .csproj file can be supplied by the author as well.
- It might be needed that the content of the site is re-published in your local instance, for all content to be shown correctly. This is done from the umbraco backend.
- The API endpoints has in some cases been inaccessible, a rebuild of the project in visual studio seems to solve this problem.
